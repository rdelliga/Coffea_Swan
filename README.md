The branch master contains the codes, when you change one of them and you want to save these local changes to your remote github repository do

git status
git add fileX 
git commit -m “whatever message explaining changes”
git push origin master

the password required to push a change is a token. My accounts's default identity are rdelliga@cern.ch and rdelliga.
